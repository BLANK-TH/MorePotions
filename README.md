# More Potions
A very VERY simple mod that adds a couple of potions to Minecraft (similar to the ones in Growthcraft, but without the 
complication or lag).

This mod is for 1.12.2 only. I will not be porting it, don't ask for that. Feel free to fork it and port it yourself 
though, it's really simple.

## Included Potions
- Haste
- Haste II
- Haste III
- Health Boost
- Fighting (Health Boost & Resistance)
- [*REDACTED*]

## Brewing Recipes
### Haste I/II/III
Potions of Speed II brewed with iron ingot, gold ingot, or diamonds
(iron gives Haste I, gold II, diamond III)

### Health Boost
Potions of Regeneration with Cooked Steak

### Fighting
Potions of Strength with an Iron Sword
